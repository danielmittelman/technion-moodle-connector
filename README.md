technion-moodle-connector
=========================

Technion Moodle Connector is a simple extension that enables the automation of the login process to moodle.technion.ac.il from any Firefox or Chrome browser. It was built by Daniel Mittelman, a student at the CS faculty in the Technion, using Jetpack (Mozilla's addon SDK) and Google Chrome's extensions API, and is built using only HTML, JavaScript and CSS3.


Usage
-----

Immediately after installation, a new icon should appear in the browser's toolbar, to the right of the
search bar, in the shape of a blue Moodle icon. To begin using the addon, click the button to set up your account details and check the "Enable Technion Moodle Connector". Restarting the browser is not required.
